# hello-world
This is the description to the hello-world repository.
This is the 3rd line within the code and is intended to be an extension to the description.
## Heading 2 must have two hashes at the beginning
**Bold text will have two asterisks each at the beginning and at the end of the bold text.** This sentence is after bold text.
### Heading 3 similarly has three hashes
*Only one asterisk each is required at the beginning and end of italic text*
> This is the first line of a blockquote.
> This is the second line of the blockquote.

There was an empty line within this markdown code above this sentence. But that wouldn't create an empty line in the viewable version.

1. Ordered list line #1
2. Ordered list line #2

A whitespace indeed has to be there after the period so that it gets encoded as an ordered list. Also an empty line between this para and the ordered list so that this para doesn't count as being within the 2nd ordered line.

- this is unordered line #1
- this is unordered line #2

`code needs this accent characters at the beginning and the end`

 ---
 The above is a horizontal rule which is denoted by three hyphens like here -> --- As can be seen, it won't work if it's in a sentence.
